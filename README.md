### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am `IHBACH Mohamed Yassine` :innocent: , a `Data Science and Modeling` student at **Al Khwarizmi, Modeling, Simulation & Data Analysis Department (MSDA)**  at **the Institute of Science, Technology & Innovation (IST&I)**, within **Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P)**
<br>

### I am full of inquisitiveness, thirst for knowledge and lust for learning.

### interested in : 

- Data mining , Machine learing and Deep learning 
- NLP, Text mining and Web mining
- Data visualization and Business Intelligence
- Distributed computing and HPC
- Multi-agent modeling
- Stochastic modeling
- numerical analysis methods
- CyberSecurity
---

I am a `Python` lover :snake: , but also familliar with `C/C++` , `PHP` , `Javascript` , `Matlab`

Motivation for `Python` : 
- You can always write your code with python and have performance similar to `C/Fortran` or even better
- How : Using libraries that accelerate the code ( either by generating equivalent code (also parallelized) in another low level programming language or on the fly (Just in time compilation)
- Libraries :  [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba) , [Pyccel](https://github.com/pyccel/pyccel) ...
